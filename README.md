# Canvapg
Honestly, I have forgotten why I named it Canvapg. I assume I was attempting to
type "canvas-previewer" when, halfway through, I fumbled and simply tapped
random keys. Canvaspg is a tiny project that displays render changes in real-time
for canvas 2d contexts. I frequently need to construct these for Discord bots,
however, it takes a long time when there is no real-time preview.

## Current State
The code for this project is a bit messy at the moment, I am still composing my ideas
and not all functionality yet available.

Public Deployment: https://canvas.nobu.sh/

## Developing
The project is pretty straight forward, it is a vanilla TypeScript React Vite project.
